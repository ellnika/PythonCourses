List indexing
In Python (and most programming in general), you start counting lists from the number 0.
The first element in a list is “number 0”, the second is “number 1”, etc.

As a result, when you want to get single elements out of a list, you can ask a list for that number element:

  >>> a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
  >>> a[3]
  20
  >>> a[0]
  5

  Strings are lists
Because strings are lists, you can do to strings everything that you do to lists. You can iterate through them:

  string = "example"
  for c in string:
    print "one letter: " + c
